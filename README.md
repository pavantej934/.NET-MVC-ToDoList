# .NET-MVC-ToDoList
Using MVC architecture and .NET framework, I built a task tracking web application where one can easily add tasks, mark them complete and also create login's. Work in progress for adding additional features like email notifications, theme selection etc.
Technologies used are .Net MVC framework, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, SQL Server.
